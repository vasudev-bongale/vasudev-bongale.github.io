  <p>
    I'm Vasudev Bongale, a Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn where I lead the Kubernetes
    platform supporting millions of containers.

    Outside of work, I study Sanskrit and am pursuing a master's degree in it. I also enjoy
    reading and writing in Sanskrit, and you'll find some interesting verses here that could
    be inspiring. I trek when the mountains call, and I read more books than I probably should.

    This site is a small corner of the internet where I write about technology, travel,
    books, and life.
