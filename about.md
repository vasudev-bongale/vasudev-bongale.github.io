#### Hello there!

I believe I am an Engineer, and a curious learner at heart :) 


At present, I am a Master's student at North Carolina State University, majoring in Computer Systems and Networking.
I like systems, especially Linux and data.
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from spending a lot of time over a computer screen, I love travelling, reading books and learning something new. Love being adventurous and leading life with full energy and enthusiasm. 

Please refer to my Resume/CV for other details. (Shortly)
