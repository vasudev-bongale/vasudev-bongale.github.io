> Sometimes it's the journey that teaches you a lot about your destination - Drake

Well, I once took a journey to the top of one of the peaks of The Mighty Himalayas and I can not agree more. For a long while, I had been yearning to do this, and you know, what they say -

> ''Sometimes all you need is a great friend and thirst for adventure".

Pondering over a hot coffee, I took an abrupt pause during an evening walk with my close friend, when I discovered that he shared a wish for the same adventure. It was a sheer stroke of serendipity! Within no time, the itinerary was formed and we were already lost in reverie. There are many professional communities out there working hard to take you on a memorable hike in the Himalayas and we chose [IndiaHikes](https://indiahikes.com/). We hiked to the top of Kedarkantha Peak (12500 feet) during first week of May 2018 which engraved in me, an undelible snapshot of those beautiful peaks stretching way up in the sky all around, with the winds singing paean to their might.

No great feat can be done without necessary preparation, especially as a first timer ascending into higher altitudes with backpack and extended hours of trekking. The routine of physical activity that started around 40 days earlier soon became a part of us staging both our body and mind to those 6 days of trekking.


The stories and memories thats get recorded in the Himalayas grows countless and each of them in unique in its own way.
