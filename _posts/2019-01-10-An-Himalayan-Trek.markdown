> Sometimes it's the journey that teaches you a lot about your destination - Drake

I once took a journey to the top of one of the peaks of The Mighty Himalayas and I can not agree more. Even after several years after that adventure, some first experiences come back vividly with such impeccable clarity. Although I really wanted to write those memories down, I evaded that for a long time until recently when I read a book - **Out in the Silence: After the crash** by Eduardo Strauch where he describes his 72 days ordeal being stuck in Andes Mountains and their eventual rescue. It kindled the rivulets of isloated episdoes into this small pond of memories.


Af first, it was just a remote thought. Pondering over a hot coffee, I took an abrupt pause during an evening walk with my close friend, when I discovered that he shared a wish for the same adventure. It was a sheer stroke of serendipity! Within no time, the itinerary was formed and we were already lost in reverie. There are many professional communities out there working hard to take you on a memorable hike in the Himalayas and we chose [IndiaHikes](https://indiahikes.com/). We hiked to the top of Kedarkantha Peak (12500 feet) during first week of May 2018 which engraved in me, an undelible snapshot of those beautiful peaks stretching way up in the sky all around, with the winds singing paean to their might.

No great feat can be done without necessary preparation, especially as a first timer ascending into higher altitudes with backpack and extended hours of trekking. The routine of physical activity that started around 40 days earlier soon became a part of us staging both our body and mind to those 6 days of trekking.

And then, the day finally arrived. I was so excited to meet my fellow mates, we were the first one to arrive at our meeting spot. It was outside of Uttarakhand Railway Station at dawn on a cozy day. There were two groups created for an 8 hours journey ahead. The journey took us through narrow and curvy mountain roadways, all along followed by a river in the gorge besides us. At one of the resting stops, the river was the closest. I was amazed by its serenity, its pure water showcasing beautiful pebbles on its floor and to find its gentle brush against my feet to be most refreshing. Breakfast on the way was not only super-tasty, but the view of Kempty Falls from its windows made it more delicious. I still remember how sweet and satisfying that water was from a stream flowing down through the mountain creek. I knew that this was going to be our healing *potion* for fatigue in days ahead. We spent rest of the time knowing others, enjoying those moments of silence while gazing at those mountain ranges through the windows all the way across the horizon, only broken by sound of thunders and rain. I was so enraptured for a sight of snowy-peak mountains that I remember debating with my friend for almost every other far mountain we spotted only to realize later it was clouds and not snow. In a way, it made me surrender to all the new experiences I would behold in the next few days. 

The actual trek was of 6 days, including 2 days of road travel. 


Let me go back in time when my friend and I sat in starbucks cracking our head to choose a trek from so many options that IndiaHikes provides. As a beginner, one vacillates because of two things. Most of them look for higher altitudes, have a bit of fun in snow, but at the same time, they are not confident on their preparation and the ability of body to cope up with the harsh or rather different envionmental conditions. You end up calling trek leaders, friends for suggestions, sit up all night thinking which one to choose and its funny, because the next day somehow you will get all negative feelings about that same trek!. So, To all the future trekkers out there, here I what I say. Trust your instincts, go where ``YOU'' want to explore, and no matter what you chose, I can promise you that you will never regret it. 

The stories and memories thats get recorded in the Himalayas grows countless and each of them is unique in its own way. For me, this being a special one, I decided to jot it down in this form to share the joy by inspiring others to embark on such a journey.

Thanks! I had fun writing this and hope you enjoyed this too!
Comment your best moments in one of your adventures :)
