> Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it - Greg Anderson

I once took a journey to the top of one of the peaks of The Mighty Himalayas and I can not agree more. Even after several years after that adventure, some first experiences come back vividly with such impeccable clarity. Although I really wanted to write those memories down, I evaded that for a long time until recently when I read a book - *Out in the Silence: After the crash* by Eduardo Strauch where he describes his 72 days ordeal being stuck in Andes Mountains and their eventual rescue. It kindled the rivulets of isloated episdoes into this small pond of memories.

At first, it was just a remote thought. Pondering over a hot coffee, I took an abrupt pause during an evening walk with my close friend, when I discovered that he shared a wish for the same adventure. It was a sheer stroke of serendipity! Within no time, the itinerary was formed and we were already lost in reverie. There are many professional communities out there working hard to take you on a memorable hike in the Himalayas and we chose [IndiaHikes](https://indiahikes.com/). We hiked to the top of Kedarkantha Peak (12500 feet) during first week of May 2018 which engraved in me, an undelible snapshot of those beautiful peaks stretching way up in the sky all around, with the winds singing paean to their might.

No great feat can be done without necessary preparation, especially for someone unfamiliar with dynamics of higher altitudes with added weight of backpacks and extended hours of trekking. The routine of physical activity that started around 40 days earlier soon became a part of us staging both our body and mind to those 6 days of trekking.

And then, the day finally arrived. I was so excited to meet my fellow mates, we were the first one to arrive at our meeting spot. It was outside of Uttarakhand Railway Station at dawn on a cozy day. There were two groups created for an 8 hours journey ahead. The journey took us through narrow and curvy mountain roadways, all along followed by a river in the gorge besides us. At one of the resting stops, the river was the closest. I was amazed by its serenity, its pure water showcasing beautiful pebbles on its floor and to find its gentle brush against my feet to be most refreshing. Breakfast on the way was not only super-tasty, but the view of Kempty Falls from its windows made it more delicious. I still remember how sweet and satisfying that water was from a stream flowing down through the mountain creek. I knew that it was going to be our healing *potion* for fatigue in days ahead. We spent rest of the time learning about each other, enjoying those moments of silence while gazing at those mountain ranges through the windows all the way across the horizon, only broken by sound of thunders and rain. I was so enraptured for a sight of snowy-peak mountains that I remember debating with my friend for almost every other far mountain we spotted only to realize later it was clouds and not snow. In a way, it made me surrender to all the new experiences I would behold in the next few days.

The next four days in the wild was to trek all the way upto the top of Kedarkantha and down to a base camp, followed by another day of road travel. The stories that are recorded in The Himalayas are like the colors on a soap bubble, they are vibrant and every one takes back unique memories just like colors you see on the bubble that depend on your point of view. Out of all my experiences, few are very special, that I decided to lock them here in words.

### Birds

Probably the most colorful aspect of the trek was birds. For a few days I was more of an aloof observer of passing by birds. It was mostly because of two members, one carrying a huge camera all the time, talking one moment and the next moment perfectly still gazing at some distant point only to realize later that he was actually spotting a bird. He was accompanied by the "bird-wizard" who apparently had a mobile version of a bird encylopedia and she was enthusiastic about a bird named "Monal", which according to her are extremely rare to spot in the wild. (Definitely check out that [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_monal)) But we got lucky! One afternoon after a tiring trek I spotted her running around shouting "monal, monal"!. After struggling for a while to locate the bird through the binoculars, I saw one of the most beautiful birds I had ever seen, even though it was sitting on a far away tree displaying its flamboyant colors. And there I was, a third member of the birdwatchers squad. Over the rest of the trek, we spotted atleast 20 different birds which I never knew existed before. It taught me that if you look closer, there is beauty around you, you just need to trade your attention to enjoy it.

### Getting closer to the Summit

As we reached base camp of the Kedarkantha peak, I had my first glimpse of its crown. I clearly remember convincing myself that it was not that far away, it looked so close. This campsite was in a perfect spot, the summit projecting onto you a preview and inviting you to take up the challenge. I knew I was prepared. After a delicious lunch, as I was meandering, I stumbled upon some eerie cattle skeletons left behind by predators after hunts, which made me realize that there is more to the story that it looks. I reached a vantage point which revealed far away mountain ranges with a lush green valley spread all the way across. I sat there contemplating under a clear sky as to what more lies beyond those clouds concealing my sight. Shortly, there was this billowing mass of mist or fog and watervapour rushing towards my direction, engulfing me into itself. I was left in this state where I could not see anything around me except this dense haze, not even my own feet, like I was floating in some dreamy world. As it passed, I chased as best as I can and ended up back to the camp. The next few hours took dramatic turns in the weather conditions. In no time the sky darkened with gray clouds, it poured heavy rain, even hailstorms!. We were all huddled inside a bigger tent sharing spooky stories. The thunders and that pelting ice adding music as if the nature itself was the storyteller. Since the time we arrived at this base, the visibility was poor. Except for the peak right beside us, there was nothing more. Those few hours of being peppered by rain has made us momentarily forget the serene calmness in these mountains, such that the sudden silence after the hailstorm was queer. And then I saw the most defining moment of my odyssey. I saw those beautiful mountain ranges for the first time! I don't really recall if everyone around me ran like me as a madman towards nearby ridges to get a clear view. The pure joy and admiration upon seeing something so majestic yet calm and beautiful, squeezed out some tears.

## On the peak

On my way onto the final stretch to the summit, I couldn't resist looking back down on our base camp and its diminishing size. It was a like a small smudge in that vast expanse and was soon out of sight. We started seeing patches of snow between rocks. At the peak, the mountain ranges that I saw the previous night was just the glimpse of what was I about to witness. There were peaks in every direction you see, as if the horizon was jagged. When one of the leaders started calling out names of those peaks, in my mind they personified, bringing out a sense of belonging and connection between us. Fortunately I recorded that conversation on my phone. Hearing that with my eyes closed instantaneously transports me to that exact place and moment with those mountains surveying me, the muffled voices of friends around, some taking pictures, some enjoying the silence and the wind howling. For the rest of the journey back down, a part of me was left at that peak and I still find myself go back there to enjoy that pristine beauty and calmness.

Besides these, I get excited to talk about few other incidents. During our trek down from the summit, there was light snowfall. Perhpas some of us were looking forward to it, but for me it was a pleasant surprise and that added to one of those "first" experiences. Some of us did not heed to the warnings of vultures and soon enough there were a few above us. Everything we came cross got a "Himalayan" prefix to it. Somehow that prefix made that sound more magnificent. Yes you guessed it. That was the [Himalyan Vulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_vulture). I also saw the [Himalayan Pika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_pika). As a group we played a lot of games and one night after dinner, the innumerable stars above pulled few of us out of our tents. We lay on the ground stargazing, singing melodious songs, all the while trying to be vigilant of those mules grazing around, lest they ran over on that dark night! That sky should be the most number of stars I must have seen in one night. There were many more such escapades that I could have ever expected and I am sure that the mountains won over all of us and everyone returned with a trove of happy memories with them.

And finally, I cannot complete this without quoting our local guide. Whenever we slacked and decided to take longer rests during hike, we heard him holler his motivating statement from far up ahead: "Rukna Mana Hai, Thakna Guna Hai" (Its in Hindi, which roughly translates to - Stopovers are forbidden and exhaustion is crime!)

Let me go back in time when my friend and I sat in starbucks ruminating over choosing a trek from so many options that are thrown at you. As beginners, one vacillates because of two things. Most of them look for higher altitudes, have a bit of fun in snow, but at the same time, they are not confident on their preparation and the ability of their body to cope up with the harsh or rather different envionmental conditions. You end up calling trek leaders, friends for suggestions, sit up all night thinking which one to choose and its funny, because the next day somehow you will get all negative thoughts about that same trek!. So, To all the future enthusiasts out there, here I what I say. Trust your instincts, go where *you* want to explore, of course within your comfort limits, and no matter what you chose, the Mountains promise you that you will never regret it. There is no wrong choice or right altitude. Each and every part of those Himalayas are remarkable bundles of adventure.

The Himalayan stories grow countless and each of them is unique in its own way. For me, it was a special and dear one, I decided to jot down those unforgettable moments in this form to share the joy by inspiring others to embark on such a journey.

Thanks! I had fun writing this and hope you enjoyed this too!
Comment your best moments in one of your adventures :)
